cp gas-project.json gas-project-dev.json
```

Replace `fileId` field of `gas-project-dev.json` with the `FILE_ID` value.

## Deploy latest script

```
% npm run dev
```

## Set up BigQuery tables

Goto https://console.cloud.google.com/ and check if your Timesheet project is already exsisting.
If no, please create a new project.

![paste project ID](docs/paste_project_ID.png)

Go back to the GCP project page and enable BigQuery API if it is not enabled.

![enable API](docs/enableAPI.png)

From GAS page, add BigQuery library.

![add lib](docs/enable_lib.png)

![enable BigQuery](docs/enableBigQuery.png)

Create new project and dataset from BigQuery console and copy the projectID and datasetID.
